Basic model: permanent immunity, no inflow/ outflow, not closed system

Start conditions
healthy = 18.000.000
infected_fun = 0
immune = 0
vaccinated = 0
time = 0 # in days
recover_rate =
contamination_rate = 2

#functions
infected_func = 
healthy_func = 

healthy_diff = -contamination_rate * healthy * infected_func
infected_diff = contamination_rate * healthy * infected_func
immune_diff = recoverspeed * infected_func



infected = infected people - deaths
susceptible(t) = 


Cured R(t) = c * infected function (c = constant)
infected = R**t
R = average infections per person, t = time
Cured R(t) = c * R**t
